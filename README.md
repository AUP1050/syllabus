### Attendance Policy
Students studying at The American University of Paris are expected to
attend ALL scheduled classes, and in case of absence, should contact
their professors to explain the situation. It is the student’s
responsibility to be aware of any specific attendance policy that a
faculty member might have set in the course syllabus. The French
Department, for example, has its own attendance policy, and students are
responsible for compliance. Academic Affairs will excuse an absence for
students’ participation in study trips related to their courses.

Attendance at all exams is mandatory.

IN ALL CASES OF MISSED COURSE MEETINGS, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PROFESSOR, AND FOR ARRANGING TO MAKE UP MISSED
WORK, RESTS SOLELY WITH THE STUDENT.

Whether an absence is excused or not is ALWAYS up to the discretion of
the professor or the department. Unexcused absences can result in a low
or failing participation grade. In the case of excessive absences, it is
up to the professor or the department to decide if the student will
receive an “F” for the course. An instructor may recommend that a
student withdraw, if absences have made it impossible to continue in the
course at a satisfactory level.
Students must be mindful of this policy when making their travel
arrangements, and especially during the Drop/Add and Exam Periods.

### Grading Policy
* 15% midterm exam
* 15% final exam
* 20% participation in class and attendance
* 50% assignments

### Learning Outcome
Students who successfully complete this course should be able to write,
build and test java programs and should obtain knowledge about all the
aspects of the core Java language as well as knowledge on some
additional packages and programming paradigms.
